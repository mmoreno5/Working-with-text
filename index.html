        <h1>The World of Pizza</h1>

    <!-- Pizza is scrumptious -->

        <h2>The history of Pizza</h2>
            <p>The history of pizza begins in <em>antiquity</em>, as various ancient cultures produced flatbreads with several toppings.</p>
            <p>A precursor of pizza was probably the focaccia, a flatbread known to the Romans as panis focacius, to which toppings were then added. Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, between the 16th and mid-18th century.</p>
            <p>The word pizza was first documented in AD 997 in Gaeta and successively in different parts of Central and Southern Italy. 
                Pizza was mainly eaten in Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods.</p>

        <h2>Pizza in canada</h2>
            <p>Canada's first pizzeria opened in 1948, Pizzeria <strong>Napoletana in Montreal</strong>.[38] The first pizza ovens started entering the country in the late 1950s;[39] it gained popularity throughout the 1960s, with many pizzerias and restaurants opening across the country. 
                Pizza was mostly served in restaurants and small pizzerias. Most pizza restaurants across Canada also serve popular Italian cuisine in addition to pizza, such as pasta, salad, soups and sandwiches. 
                Fast-food pizza chains also provide other side options for customers to choose from, in addition to ordering pizza, including chicken wings, fries and poutine, salad, and calzones. 
                Pizza Pops are a Canadian calzone-type snack introduced in the 1960s. Pizza chains across Canada can be found in shopping centres, schools, and neighbourhood plazas, with the majority of these chains offering a sit-and-dine facility for customers.</p>
            <p>The most distinct pizza in Canada is the "Canadian" pizza. A "Canadian" pizza is usually prepared with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and bacon. 
                 Many variations of this pizza exist, but the two standout ingredients that make this pizza distinctly Canadian are bacon and mushrooms.
                Pizzas in Canada are almost never served with "Canadian bacon", or "back bacon", as it is referred to in Canada. Rather, side bacon is the standard pork topping on pizza.</p>

         <h2>Pizza in the United States</h2> 
            <p>Pizza first made its appearance in the United States with the arrival of Italian immigrants in the late 19th century.</p> 
            <p>According to a 2009 response published in a column on Serious Eats, the first printed reference to "pizza" served in the US is a 1904 article in The Boston Journal. 
                Giovanni and Gennaro Bruno came to America from Naples, Italy, in 1903 and introduced the Neapolitan pizza to Boston. Later, Vincent Bruno (Giovanni's son) went on to open the first pizzeria in Chicago.</p>
